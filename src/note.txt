REDUX
-----

props drilling 
    - data will stuck in any intermediate component when the component 
      have any issues 
    - props drilling occures during coupling(many connection between parent and child)

so react introduced a state management technolagy - redux 


 a js store file 


libraries

    redux
    react-redux
    redux-thunk
